# Event and Venue Management & Booking System


## Introduction

Managing events and venues manually can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Whether it's finding the right venue, handling bookings, or tracking event details, stakeholders often face challenges due to lack of centralized systems. This project aims to solve that by providing a digital platform that simplifies and automates the entire event and venue management lifecycle.


## My Solution

The **Event and Venue Management & Booking System** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline venue discovery, booking, and event coordination. It offers:

- A responsive frontend built with **React.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
- A robust backend powered by **.NET 8**, handling business logic and API services.
- A secure and scalable **PostgreSQL** database for storing user, venue, booking, and review data.
- Role-based access for **Customers**, **Venue Owners**, and **Admins**.
- Real-time booking management, review system, and admin analytics dashboard.

## Project Summary
The Event and Venue Management & Booking System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the management, booking, and administration of venues and events. It enables venue owners, event organizers, and customers to efficiently handle the entire event lifecycle, from listing and booking venues to managing payments, schedules, and reviews. The system facilitates real-time availability checks, secure booking, and provides reviews for better decision-making.

This platform bridges the gap between venue providers and customers, offering an intuitive and reliable digital solution that enhances operational efficiency and improves the overall user experience.
